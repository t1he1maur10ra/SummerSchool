# Welcome to Summer School 2018 / 2019
This class will be run for 8 hrs a week Wednesday and Thursday from 10:00am till 2:00pm.

## Getting started
To start making applications in C#, there are a couple of things we need to make sure that we understand befor we dive into coding. The first thing we need to cover is which IDE (Integrated development environment) we will use. Throughout this and subsequent courses there are two main IDE's you will need to be familiar with, the first is Visual Studio and the second is Visual Studio Code. 

## Visual Studio 2017
The First IDE we will look at is Visual Studio 2017, this is the full IDE developed and released by Microsoft to work with and develope around:
* .net framework
* Azure
* Mobile app and cross platform development
* MS SQL and many more components used in modern application development.

### How to get it

## Visual Studio Code
The second IDE we will touch on is Visual Studio Code. This IDE is like a lightweight version of Visual Stdio 2017 in that its main purpose is as a code editor and with many of the compiler components removed its design gives itself more to backend and web development rather than the full functionality thats in VS 2017. Being so lightweight means the application can easily be installed and run on less powerfull machines without affecting the performace.

### Creating a variable and assigning a user input to it.
