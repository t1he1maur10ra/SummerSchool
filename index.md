## Welcome to Summer School 2018 / 2019
This class will be run for 8 hrs a week Wednesday and Thursday from 10:00am till 2:00pm.
## Getting started

The first thing we need to cover is which IDE (Integrated development environment) we will use. Throughout this and subsequent courses there are two main IDE's you will need to be familiar with, the first is Visual Studio and the second is Visual Studio Code.
